https://github.com/Ossssip/Strip_Map/assets/1376844/4b5c1aac-e0f3-4976-9c0f-cde7862b3e1f
A strip map inspired by [@stevefaeembra's map](https://mapstodon.space/@stevefaeembra/112175168261635341), implemented in Python. It shows buildings reprojected to a straight line along the M8 tram route in Berlin.
Data is from OpenStreetMaps, osmnx is used to collect features, shapely and geopandas for polygon manipulations, and Pillow and Matplotlib for image generation.
